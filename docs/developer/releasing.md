# ![DB Shepherd](/images/dbshepherd.png) DB Shepherd Release Process

In order to encourage frequent releases, the release process has been automated
as much as possible.

1. Create release tag in Github
2. Checkout that tag and build //release/...
3. Upload the binaries to Github
4. Tag the docker image properly
5. Upload the docker image to dockerhub
